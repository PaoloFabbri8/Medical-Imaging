## Medical Imaging – Course Overview

This repository contains exercise material for a course on medical imaging methods and their applications in clinical medicine and neuroscience.

### Learning outcomes

After completing the course the student is able to:

- **describe the physical principles of each method**
- **analyze the applicability of the covered imaging methods in research and clinical imaging**
- **describe the instrumentation required for these methods**
- **explain the advantages, disadvantages, and risks of each method**

### Course content

The course focuses on the **basic principles** and **applications** of imaging methods used in clinical medicine and neuroscience, including:

- **Digital radiology (DR)**
- **Computed tomography (CT)**
- **Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)**
- **Ultrasound imaging (US)**
- **Positron emission tomography (PET)**
- **Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)**
- **Near-infrared spectroscopic imaging (NIRS)**
- **Electroencephalography (EEG)**
- **Magnetoencephalography (MEG)**
- **Navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS)**

**Multimodal imaging** – the combined use of several imaging and neurophysiological methods – is also discussed to highlight how complementary information from different modalities can be integrated.

### Teaching approach

Many of the lectures are given by **guest lecturers**, who are experts in the application of each imaging method. This ensures that:

- **theoretical concepts** are linked to **real-world clinical and research examples**
- students gain insight into **current practices, limitations, and future developments** in medical imaging
